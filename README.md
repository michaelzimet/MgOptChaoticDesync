# Figures
The scripts beginning with Fig enable the user to reproduce the corresponding figure in the paper. Note these require the user to manually vary the constraint value and do a number of runs, as indicated in the comments. These scripts generate Figs 1-6 and Fig 10, whereas Figs 7-9 are generated by EBC.
